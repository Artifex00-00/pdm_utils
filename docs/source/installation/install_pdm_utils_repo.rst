pdm_utils source code repository
================================

Some ``pdm_utils`` tools may require non-Python data files that are not directly installed with the Python package. Instead, these files are available on the ``pdm_utils`` git repository, which can be accessed through :pdmutils:`GitHub <>` and downloaded as follows:

    #. Open a Terminal window.
    #. Navigate to a directory where the source code subdirectory should be installed (for example, your home directory)::

        > cd

    #. Enter the following command::

        > git clone https://github.com/SEA-PHAGES/pdm_utils.git

There should now be a ``pdm_utils`` directory installed locally.
