Introduction
============

``pdm_utils`` is a Python package designed to facilitate the creation, management, and manipulation of MySQL phage genomics databases in the :seaphages:`SEA-PHAGES program <>`.

``pdm_utils`` contains several types of tools:

    1. Python library including:

        a. Classes to store/parse phage genome, interact with a MySQL database, and manage instructions to add, remove, and update genomes.

        b. Functions and methods to manipulate those classes as well as interact with several databases and servers, including PhagesDB, GenBank, PECAAN, and MySQL.

    2. Data processing pipelines to maintain a phage genomics database.

``pdm_utils`` is useful for:

    1. The Hatfull lab to maintain MySQL phage genomics databases in the SEA-PHAGES program.

    2. Researchers to directly access and retrieve phage genomics data.

    3. Researchers to create custom MySQL phage genomics databases.

    4. Developers to build downstream data analysis tools.
