Ticket tracking
===============

With new genome sequences and annotations routinely becoming available for PhameratorDB, and with thousands of researchers routinely using Phamerator, many updates and issues relating to the general management of PhameratorDB, or specifically to the Actino_Draft instance, arise. Together, these diverse actions constitute database “tickets”, such as:

    - New genome sequences need to be auto-annotated and imported
    - New preliminary final annotations need to be reviewed and imported
    - Updated SEA-PHAGES genomes in GenBank need to be imported
    - New non-SEA-PHAGES genomes in GenBank need to be imported
    - Changes need to be made to genome information (e.g. host, cluster, etc.) or to gene information (e.g. coordinates, descriptions, etc.)
    - Genes need to be added or removed

Systematically maintaining and addressing tickets provides a framework for efficient database management. As a result, two separate ticket tracking systems have been developed:

    1. :ref:`ticketemail`
    2. :ref:`ticketimport`
