Email tickets
=============

In order to handle and control requests and notifications regarding new database tickets from various sources, an email-based ticket tracking system has been developed. The email account, phamerator.qc@gmail.com, provides a standardized communication channel between the database administrator and end-users to improve database management by tracking, addressing, and storing unstructured tickets in the form of emails. Tickets can be submitted from any end-user regarding:

    1. Availability of new genome sequences or new preliminary final annotations
    2. Revisions to final annotations
    3. Specific issues, miscellaneous issues, or questions about the database

All tickets that need to be addressed are stored in the inbox. After they are addressed, the originator (or submitter) of the ticket can be directly notified that it has been addressed. A history of tickets can therefore be maintained and managed.
